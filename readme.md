## Simon Says:

Create a new c# console application. Have the application generate a random string for the user to repeat (you can create a list of all possible strings and just select a random one). Then either print out "Simon says {string name}" or just "{string name}". The user should repeat the string if it says "simon says" and if it doesn't then they should submit a blank response.

If the user gets anything wrong then the game is over you should display game over text.

Stretch:

 - Add a score that tracks every time the user is right.
 - Generate a completely random string (instead of just grabbing a random one from a list).
